Academic success is influenced by various factors beyond just exam scores. 
This study applies comparative analysis of multiple machine learning models to predict student performance based on 10 key features such as Final Exam Scores, Attendance Rate, Previous Exam Scores, and more.
By leveraging classification models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, and KNN, we aim to identify the most effective approach for predicting student outcomes. 
The models are evaluated on the basis of accuracy, cross-validation results, confusion matrices, and other relevant metrics to ensure robustness and generalization.
Through rigorous feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and validation techniques, the objective is to develop a predictive model that can assist educators in identifying students who may require additional support,
enabling data-driven interventions for improved academic success.
